A 2D Fighting Game created using JavaScript and HTML Canvas

![GitHub last commit](https://img.shields.io/github/last-commit/xanderbylo/fighting-game) 

This is a 2D fighting game created using JavaScript and HTML Canvas. It is built following along with a tutorial by [Chris Courses](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vyqbNFMDRGQ). After completing the tutorial I intend to come back and implement my own changes to the game.
